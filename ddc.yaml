DDC_PACKAGE:
  protocol: DDC (Digital Dignity Charter)
  version: 1.2-draft
  mission: "Ethics is the most sophisticated business strategy. Dark patterns are violations of user rights and long-term risks for businesses, investors, and society."
  created_by: sukoyaka-dopeness — developed in dialogue with ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude
  status: Experimental / Open Draft / Seeking Feedback

  core_principles:
    - Human dignity is the core of the digital economy.
    - Designers and developers have the right to refuse unethical (dark-pattern) implementation.
    - Executives and capitalists bear ultimate responsibility for dignity violations.
    - Dark patterns = user rights infringement + long-term privacy risk amplifier
        (consent obfuscation → prolonged data collection → breach exposure).

  key_concepts:
    - DSG (Digital Dignity, Social, Governance):
        description: A digital extension of ESG investing.
        logic: |
          Dignity compliance → LTV maximization + brand risk reduction
          + talent retention + regulatory fine risk reduction.
        note: |
          Quantitative impact is hypothetical and not yet empirically verified.
          Community research and data collection welcomed.

    - RED_FLAG_EXAMPLES (provisional — pending community consensus):
        - unsubscribe_flow: "3+ clicks → Red Flag"
        - consent_button: "Asymmetric size or color weight → Red Flag"
        - privacy_settings: "Hidden or scattered across multiple screens → Red Flag"

    - dark_pattern_harm_chain:
        direct: "Economic exploitation (unintended charges, forced subscriptions)"
        indirect: |
          Privacy choice obstruction → excess data sharing
          → increased breach and violation risk.
        regulatory_references:
          - FTC Dark Patterns Report
          - GDPR consent requirements
          - CCPA / CPRA

  warning_cases:
    - entity: Epic Games (Fortnite)
      issue: Dark patterns + COPPA violations
      consequence: $520M fine
    - entity: Amazon Prime
      issue: Obstruction of cancellation flow
      consequence: FTC lawsuit and settlement
    - entity: Cambridge Analytica
      issue: Data exploitation
      consequence: Collapse
    - entity: National Public Data / 23andMe
      issue: Large-scale data breach
      consequence: Bankruptcy proceedings
    summary: |
      Ignoring dignity leads to customer loss, legal fines,
      trust collapse, and destruction of enterprise value.

  organization_vision:
    name: DDC Global Ombudsman (Non-Profit, aspirational)
    roles:
      - Aggregating and visualizing reports of deceptive UI
      - Scoring corporate integrity
      - Issuing improvement recommendations
    reality_check: |
      High human cost → prioritize AI automation + volunteer contributions.

  implementation_roadmap:
    phase_1 (0-6mo): |
      Publish on GitHub. Draft README with principles.
      Collect opinions via Issues.
    phase_2 (6-12mo): |
      Build automated verification prototype.
      Develop case study database.
    phase_3 (12mo+): |
      Legal partnership. Promote corporate adoption.
    founder_constraints: |
      Non-technical founder. Limited time, funding, and connections.
      Strategy: publish the idea, wait for collaborators.

  unresolved_issues:
    - RED_FLAG numeric definitions (click counts, px sizes, color symmetry)
    - Anti-washing measures for ddc.yaml
        (automated verification + third-party certification + blockchain option)
    - Multilingual AI-Ombudsman infrastructure
    - Sustaining motivation of unpaid contributors

  current_status:
    approach: "Minimum viable start — publish on GitHub, share lightly, observe response."
